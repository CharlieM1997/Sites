# Sites
Two sites I've created in the past, mostly with HTML and CSS.

Unfortunately, most of my web work, especially my work with JavaScript, was stored on my University's servers and all of my files stored on there were destroyed after my graduation before I had the chance to recover them. These were the sites that I have stored at home.

## Check

Check is a very small, incomplete site I created in my first term of University (late 2016). Unfortunately, the finished version is lost as it was stored on my University's servers and I didn't have the chance to recover it in time.

## Style Stomps

Style Stomps is another small, shoe shop site I created in my second term of College (early 2015). I created it entirely with HTML & CSS in Notepad++, aside from a very basic email and search form with a few lines of JavaScript.
